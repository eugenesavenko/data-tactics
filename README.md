# Data Tactics

*Note: This is a half-baked work in progress.*

In chess, there's a distinction between [__strategy__](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_strategy) and [__tactics__](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_tactic). Strategy relates to long-term plans, while tactics relate to short-term plans. Strategy takes years or decades to master; anyone can learn tactics in a matter of hours or days. Ultimately, strategy is composed of tactics, much like paintings are composed of brushstrokes. And, perhaps, much like data analysis is built upon data tactics.

Chess tactics are, essentially, [short sequences of moves](http://www.chessfornovices.com/chessstrategyvstactics.html). Likewise, you can think of "data tactics" as short sequences of computational moves: adding all the numbers in a list, or sorting spreadsheets by a column. Individually, they won't win any games — or reveal any insight — on their own. But, in combination, they can add up to a powerful strategy.

The goal of this repository is to catalog these tactics, from the most obvious and basic to the more complex.

## Summarizing Tactics

Tactics to summarize a list of numbers.

- Minimum
- Maximum
- Range
- Mean
- Median
- Mode
- Count
- Sum
- Standard deviation

## Transformational Tactics

Tactics to transform individual bits of data.

- Round
- Log(arithm)
- Square root
- Classify
- Geocode
- Dimensionality reduction
- Feature extraction
- Normalization (of text)

## Combinatory Tactics

Tactics that combine two or more lists of data.

- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (e.g., X per capita)

## Comparative Tactics

Tactics to compare one value to a broader set of numbers.

- Rank
- Percentiles / quantiles
- Percent difference
- Z-score

## Structural Tactics

Tactics to reshape/reorganize data tables.

- Sort
- Filter/subset
- Transpose
- Join
 
## Combinatory Tactics

Tactics that combine two or more more basic tactics.

- Grouped summary statistics
- Crosstabs / pivot tables
