# Data Tactics

A half-baked idea: Conceptual building blocks for data analysis. Analogy with [chess tactics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_tactic) (vs. strategy).

The goal of this repository is to catalog these tactics, from the most obvious and basic to the more complex. The focus is on structured, [tabular](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(information)) data (rather than say, [network-graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) data).

## Summarizing Tactics

Tactics to summarize a list of numbers.

- Minimum
- Maximum
- Range
- Mean
- Median
- Mode
- Count
- Sum
- Standard deviation

## Transformational Tactics

Tactics to transform individual bits of data.

- Round
- Log(arithm)
- Square root
- Classify
- Geocode
- Dimensionality reduction
- Feature extraction
- Normalization (of text)

## Combinatory Tactics

Tactics that combine two or more lists of data.

- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (e.g., X per capita)

## Comparative Tactics

Tactics to compare one value to a broader set of numbers.

- Rank
- Percentiles / quantiles
- Percent difference
- Z-score

## Structural Tactics

Tactics to reshape/reorganize data tables.

- Sort
- Filter/subset
- Transpose
- Join
 
## Combinatory Tactics

Tactics that combine two or more more basic tactics.

- Grouped summary statistics
- Crosstabs / pivot tables
